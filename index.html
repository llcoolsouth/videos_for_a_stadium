        The UK Art Museum is pleased to announce Videos for a Stadium, a presentation of sports-related videos by a range of nationally known artists, screened at Commonwealth Stadium on Thursday, April 6, from 7-9 pm. This unique ‘art meets sports” event explores competition, skill, endurance, teamwork, and body movement. The national anthem, the green grass of various fields, and sports language are also examined. The videos will be presented on the stadium’s high resolution screen and viewed from field level seats in the end zone.
